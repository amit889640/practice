Hooks
useRef()
The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.
It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.
It can be used to access a DOM element directly.

To handle the error
componentDidCatch() life cycle is use to catch the error we can't use this in hook 

In a controlled component react, state handles all the form data, whereas, 
In an uncontrolled component, the HTML form element data is managed by only the DOM,  So in order to access any value that has been entered we take the help of refs.

Controlled components are predictable since the component manages the state of the form elements.
Because the form elements may change or be impacted by external sources over the lifespan of a component, uncontrolled components are not predictable.
