// 1st Round:

// Q. Write code:
// 1. String contains substring
// 2. Index of substring
// 3. no of occurrence of substring
// Without using String class methods

// Q. What is generics? Purpose of generics.
// A. type safety at compile time.
// Q. What happens in runtime?
// A. java erasure
// Q. how does it obtain the info of the class?

// Q. Annotations related to Hibernate? How are those internally implemented?
// Q. create custom annotation.
// Q. what is a comparator? how does comparator work internally?
// Q. what data structure would u prefer for searching large data sets?
// Q. inner join

// 2nd Round:

// Explain project.
// Implement SkippingIterator.
// What is deadlock?
// What is race condition?
// What design patterns do u know?
// What are SOLID principles?
// What is dependency injection and Inversion of control?
// difference between GET/POST/PUT/PATCH
// difference between controller and restcontroller?

// What is threadlocal?
// synchronized keyword for objects and classes
// finally block execution

// Interview Experience-
// Round 1:
// Explain your micro services project. Why it is good? How to handle failure/ service down?
// Implement a caching service using java and the runtime memory.
// Implement an iterator which prints alternate elements.
// Round 2:
// Purely java based round. All the aspects of core java was touched in this round.
// Round 3:
// Tech arch round. The arch came with a question printed on a paper. The question was ambiguous and hence there doesnâ€™t exist an exact solution but they will expect the same code which they have in their mind.
// No questions from Data Structures or system design.
// This round was really a turn off for me.

// Given two linked list, can you tell if they intersect or not and if yes, at which node?

// Given array of walls of different heights. give the maximum amount of water that it can hold.

// Given an array of numbers containing a duplicates for every number except one element. Find the unique element


// Different design related questions, which could be resolved using Decorator, Observer, Iterator and other patterns.

// Promises, async / await are tools in JavaScript for handling asynchronous code more elegantly.
// what are three important states in JavaScript promise ?
// xplain destructuring for Array, Object or String in JavaScript, and what are uses ?
// Explain the Pure function in the javascript
// A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.
// what is currying in the javascript
// It is a technique in functional programming, that transforms the function of multiple arguments into several functions of a single argument in sequence.
// explain sorting principles with examples

// Asked to explain design patterns
// Rest API interview questions mandatory
// Check balanced parenthesis
